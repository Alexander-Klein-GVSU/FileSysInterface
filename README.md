# FileSysInterface
This is a small project assigned in my Operating Systems Concepts Class. What it does is it checks every single file in the user's directory and adds any found changes to a changelog file that it creates. On my personal laptop, I have this program set up in Ubuntu to check every file in my Ubuntu home directory upon startup.
## How to Run:
- Compile the program and run it. (During its first run, it will detect every single file in your user directory as an added file.)
- Make a small change to an insignificant file or add a new file to your computer.
- Run the program again.
- Check the changelog file in the directory that you put the compiled program in, and you should see the file in there, along with the "files.txt" and "changelog.txt" files.
